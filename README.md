# FitBit-Social-Network
This application is developed mainly for fitness enthusiasts who would like to share their fitness activites with their family and friends.
In this application, users can post fitness updates and can share it with their friends. We have developed social networking features such as newsfeed, likes, commments for the activities. 

We have also used different strategies to develop an effective website. Some of them are Search Engine Optimization , Pagination , Security.

The server for the application was build using Spring MVC 4. A token based authentication is used for authenticating users using JJWT (https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt). Password encryption has been done using BCrypt. The application has one custom thread for fetching data from Fitbit. All the application functionality is exposed using REST Api. The UI for the application was made using HTML, CSS (Flexbox for layout), JavaScript, some bootstrap, and Jquery.
